A simple stancer for FiveM
===============================

Stancing a vehicle on the move. Not a problem with this simple stancer.

Prequisites
------------------------

The car you want to use this stancers needs  to have these 2 values (fCamberFront and fCamberRear) in handling.meta inside SubhandlingData
```
<SubHandlingData>
    <Item type="CCarHandlingData">  
      <fCamberFront value="-0.000000"/>          
      <fCamberRear value="-0.000000"/>
    </Item>
</SubHandlingData>
```

Special Thanks
